# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure

- `src/`: React + TypeScript desktop UI. Components live in `src/components/`, Zustand stores in `src/stores/`, helpers in `src/lib/` and `src/utils/`.
- `electron/`: Electron main/preload, IPC, SQLite, indexing, import, thumbnails, collector, and AI metadata logic.
- `extensions/shiguang-collector/`: browser extension for image collection.
- `website/`: Rspress documentation site.
- Do not commit generated output: `out/`, `dist/`, `release/`, `website/doc_build/`.

## Commands

Use npm; this Electron app relies on `package-lock.json` and native dependencies.

- `npm run dev`: start electron-vite, Vite on `127.0.0.1:1420`, and Electron.
- `npm run renderer:dev`: start only the renderer dev server.
- `npm run build`: type-check and build renderer, main, and preload into `out/`.
- `npm run dist`: package with electron-builder.
- `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix`: run or fix Oxlint.
- `npm run fmt` / `npm run fmt:check`: run or check oxfmt.
- `npm run docs:dev` / `npm run docs:build`: serve or build `website/`.

After `npm install`, run `npx electron-builder install-app-deps` if native Electron modules such as `better-sqlite3` need rebuilding.

## Electron Development

- Keep dev services on `127.0.0.1`; never switch them back to `localhost`.
- Reuse existing repo-owned dev processes when possible; stop stale repo-scoped Electron/Vite processes before relaunching.
- Configure Chrome DevTools MCP with the official `--browser-url=http://127.0.0.1:9223` option so it attaches to Electron instead of launching its default standalone Chrome profile.
- Before any browser MCP command for desktop UI verification, make sure the Electron dev app is already running. Prefer an existing repo-owned `npm run dev` process; if none exists, start `npm run dev` and wait until `http://127.0.0.1:9223/json/list` exposes a page whose URL starts with `http://127.0.0.1:1420/`.
- Browser MCP is valid only when connected to that Electron CDP target on `127.0.0.1:9223`; `about:blank`, a normal Chrome tab, or a standalone `127.0.0.1:1420` page means it is misconfigured.
- Do not use standalone Chrome at `127.0.0.1:1420` for desktop verification; that path lacks Electron preload, IPC, native windows, menus, dialogs, and drag-and-drop.
- If proxy env vars are present, bypass them for local CDP with `NO_PROXY=127.0.0.1,localhost` or equivalent.

## Coding Style

- Follow local style: TypeScript, 2-space indentation, and double quotes in newer files.
- Use PascalCase for React component files. Use existing lower camelCase patterns for stores, hooks, helpers, and service modules.
- Keep Electron business logic in `electron/`; expose only whitelisted preload APIs.
- Use Tailwind utilities in JSX and shared class helpers such as `src/lib/utils.ts`.
- Refactor large files only when it helps the requested change.

## UI Design

- Keep the overall UI simple, quiet, and focused; avoid visual noise that does not support the user task.
- Do not overuse borders, dividers, outlines, or decorative lines. Prefer spacing, alignment, and subtle background differences to separate content.
- Do not wrap everything in cards. Use cards only when grouping repeated, self-contained items or when a framed surface is truly needed.
- Do not put unrelated explanatory copy directly on the page. Avoid visible instructions, feature descriptions, or design rationale unless they are essential to the workflow.
- Preserve a clean visual style across new screens and components, with restrained density, typography, color, and hierarchy.

## Engineering Principles

- Think from first principles: clarify the underlying user need, runtime constraints, and data flow before choosing an implementation.
- Prefer systematic root-cause fixes over surface patches.
- Respect existing architecture and local helper APIs before adding new abstractions.
- Keep changes scoped; do not rewrite unrelated code or generated files.

## Database Migrations

- Keep SQLite migrations in `electron/database/migrations/`.
- Use `PRAGMA user_version` and focused steps such as `v4-to-v5.ts`.
- Keep `electron/database.ts` thin.
- Add data migrations only for code that has shipped. For unreleased development changes, update the new shape directly.
- Before changing existing user databases, create a backup and run migrations in a transaction.
- Add or update migration tests when a test harness exists; for Electron ABI/native behavior, verify through Electron rather than plain Node.

## Testing

- Before PRs, run at least `npm run lint` and `npm run build`.
- For desktop UI or interaction changes, also verify the changed screen in the actual Electron app.
- For UI interaction bugs, test the real user event path early; add targeted logs around `pointerdown`, `click`, or menu selection when needed.
- Final verification must say which path was used: Electron CDP, actual Electron window, or blocked. A standalone Chrome load of `127.0.0.1:1420` never counts as desktop UI verification.

## Commits and PRs

- Use short, imperative Chinese commit subjects, matching recent history such as `筛选` or `修改db存储路径`.
- Keep commits focused.
- PRs should include summary, verification steps, linked issues when relevant, and screenshots or recordings for UI changes.
- Mention packaging, release, or docs impact explicitly when applicable.
